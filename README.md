# Eulerize graph function
 Eulerize graph function for Mathematica. Part of FindPostmanTour, FindShorestestPath, OptimumFlowData, and  MaxClique
Eulerizegraph is available from the mathematica resource repository at https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/EulerizeGraph/.
EulerizeGraph on the Function Repository currentl only supports undirected unweighted graphs.
EulerizeGraph is being updated to support weighted undirected graphs with the function FindEdgeCover.
I plan to add support for directed and mixed graphs both unweighted and weighted later.
The graph input has to be connected.
Other areas of research include hypergraphs and multigraphs.
